# Image Classification and Digital Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **image classification and digital detection** by leveraging **machine learning and deep learning** techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that can accurately classify images and detect digital elements within them. The project utilizes **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and traditional machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in classification and detection tasks.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- **Feature Extraction**: Using deep learning models like **ResNet, VGG16, and MobileNet**
- **Classification**: Implemented with **CNNs, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN**
- **Digital Detection**: Object detection with **YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD**
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- **Deployment**: Flask-based API or Streamlit web application

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available datasets such as:
- **CIFAR-10**: A small dataset of 60,000 images in 10 classes
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 1 million images
- **MNIST**: Handwritten digit classification dataset

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Flask/Streamlit (for deployment)
